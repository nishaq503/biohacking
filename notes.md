# BioHacking Notes

Interview with Jamie Metzel. Book: Hacking Darwin

16.45 The biotech and genetic revolutions are going to completely change our lives.

Specialists talk in a coded language to facilitate communication among themselves.
But the technologies we are developing are going to have species-wide impacts.
We need to communicate with the public and make sure that we develop the science and the ethics in concert.
23.00 If the science is dissociated from the public discourse around the science, it can kill the science.
<!-- We saw this with GMOs, formerly Recombinant DNA, where the scientists were responsible, went to Asilomar, and established principles in the 1970s.
The principles were realized but because there was no public engagement from the start, there is still a lot of fear among the public and the science has not realized its potential. -->

However there is a strong argument to be made for the position that we should let these developments fly under the radar.
Scientists are by and large responsible and we should let them do their work.
In the near term, the applications of this tech are going to be in curing genetic diseases and not making designer babies.
Poking the hornets' nest in this way could cause people on one side or the other of the abortion issue to build and man new barricades.
We could instead let this emerge in much the same way as IVF where, by the time the issue drew public attention, people in evangelical communities were already speaking in church of the miracle of life.

I believe that we are talking about technologies that are everyone's business and we need to respect each other enough to have this conversation out in the open.
We cannot afford to make the same mistake that we did in the beginning of the GMO era.

23.30 There are plenty of reasons to be afraid.
Will our stories around these genetic modifications leading us to adaptive fears which cause us to come up with wise restrictions for how we do our science and engineering?
Or will we spend our time worrying about the wrong thing because some benign modification, because of the way that it is phrased, catches the public eye and causes a panic that shuts down the science?
Can we figure out which fears are adaptive and which are maladaptive?

Write three stories:
    * the dystopian
    * the utopian
    * the impasse

28.00 We have many bugs in our genetic code. These cause our children to die from deadly genetic diseases.
Our elderly suffer from dementia and alzheimer's.
First in the crosshair are the single-gene-mutation disorders Mendelian Disorders (get examples).
There are ~10,000 identified and ~5,000 well categorized.
Since we know what genes to look for, we can identify them in fertilized embryos during IVF.
This can be done by sequencing some placenta cells.
With the cost of sequencing going towards negligibility, this is becoming increasingly doable.
For example, out the the, say 10, fertilized embryos in a lab, we can tell if a child, if carried to term, will die of Tay-Sachs.
<!-- In parts of europe where the government pays for pre-natal screening, of the people that receive the diagnosis at three months that their baby is going to have down syndrome, 97% choose to abort. -->
From this we can impute that almost no one will choose to implant the one-in-ten embryo if they knew that the child would suffer from such a genetic disease.

The scary side of this is that we will then make choices about our children beyond simple health.
We will know the probabilities of personality traits, intelligence, height, etc and will choose according to the cultural and economic norms of the day.
For example, sickle-cell-anemia.
If you carry two alleles of the trait, you will likely die.
However, if you are a recessive carrier then you have much higher resistance against malaria at some cost to hemoglobin's oxygen carrying ability.
This trait emerged in areas with high threat of malaria as a genetic response.
But in the United States, where we have eliminated malaria, sickle-cell-anemia is seen as a disease.
Through embryo selection, we could select out the gene for sickle-cell anemia from our species, leaving us vulnerable to malaria.
30.25 We have no idea what recessive traits we may be carrying that could help our species survive some threat we have not faced in recorded history.

Once we start changing things, we will not stop.
Columbus' arrival in the new world sparked a chain reaction that is going to this day.
We cannot think of nature as separate from us and us as "screwing with nature".
We are nature, nature is us and nature is always changing.
This makes nature natural to hack and we homo-sapiens, with tool usage as our comparative advantage, are hackers.

36.00 In China, the worlds first gene-edited babies were born in October 2018.
It was announced by the biophysicist He Jiankui what two little gene-edited girls were born in China.
First in China, in People's Daily, this was lauded as a Chinese triumph but there was swift international backlash.
This was controversial for a number of reasons:
    * the concent of the parents was mis-informed.
    * he did not get approval from the hospital.
The target mutation was a gene called CCR5.
The father had HIV while the mother did not.
In such a case in a country with advanced medicine such as China, or the United States, there are many ways for a couple such as this to have a child who will not have HIV.
He Jiankui tried to modify the CCR5 gene to make it similar to what some europeans have, where they have two disrupted copies, that make them more susceptible to the West Nile virus but increased resistance to HIV.
He was not trying to solve an existing problem but was trying to create an enhancement.
A few months later a report came out that mice with the same mutation were doing better with mazes than mice without it.
This sparked concerns that the two babies were engineered to be smarter.
Soon after this another study came out, by looking at data from the UK bio-bank, that found a correlation between this mutation and lifespans among europeans.
People with the mutation were living shorter lives.
This is to say that our knowledge of genetics is very limited and we do not know how altering one gene in such a way will cause other changes in our physiology.

The age of human genetic modification has begun.
The third Chinese genetically-engineered baby has probably already been born.
<!-- The russian scientist Dennis Rebrikov has announced that he has five parents lined up. -->
This is going to from 2 to 3 to 8 and exponentially grow from there.
Within a decade, we will have thousands of genetically engineered babies.

39.30 We do not know what trade-offs we have made through the course of our evolution.
To borrow from finance, we might be on a interior point of the efficient frontier.
We might be able to take two things that are involved in a trade-off and optimize for both of them to reach a point of the efficient frontier where the trade-off starts to bind.
So far we understand some the variables involved in our genetics but we do not understand most of them.
We used to say that "there's a gene for that": the short gene, the tall gene, the smart gene etc.
Now we have a poly-genic hypothesis that most of our traits are mediated by many genes, and often each gene has very little to say.
There is also an omni-genic hypothesis that is even more complicated.
To understand these tradeoffs, we will need a far greater understanding of genetics.

Our future is going to involve embryo selection, which will likely move us towards the end of procreative sex.
We will then have the ability to use stem cells to grow a functionally unlimited number of eggs, in InVitro-Gameto-Genesis.

CRISPR is a gene-editing tool that can be thought of as analogous to a text editor.
The genome is a string of letters.
There is a cursor that is the guide RNA.
There is a cutting enzyme, the most popular is CAS9.
We usually make a double-stranded cut, like cutting something in a text editor and leaving it deleted.
Or we can add something instead.
Every day, there are not just stories of more applications of CRISPR but new types of gene-editing tools.
We are very rapidly moving into a world where we will be able to edit our genomes at will.
This introduces the concept induced biological variability.
Today we expect that our next phone will be better and faster than the last.
But we have this adherence to our biology that I am homo-sapien and my kids are homo-sapiens.
The idea that we can rewrite our biology even though we intellectually understand that we went from a single-celled state to homo-sapien over 4 Billion years.
This is a large change we will see over the 21st century.

Should we be playful, excited or terrified by this?
We have been capable of gene editing for quite a while.
Our new tools are just orders of magnitude more powerful, more precise, and less expensive in time and materials.
We used to make genetic changes to crops not just by selective breeding but also by bombarding them with radiation.
We found grapes without seeds and chose to make more of them.
Now we are able to be much more targeted with the changes we can make.

We also have good reason to be terrified when talking about the future of human life.
<!-- In our country we have many people who fled here from Nazism. -->
<!-- If we asked the Nazis what they were doing, they would have said that they were implementing Darwinism. -->
<!-- We had Nuremberg trials about human experimentation. -->
<!-- To make an extreme understatement, many Jewish communities were on the losing end of a eugenics experiment writ-large, gone mad. -->
And yet we are uncomfortable with the fact that eugenics does not really mean anything.
Mate selection is another form of genetic selection and if you decide that dinner and a movie is eugenics then you have drawn the line at a very wrong level.
On the other hand, we can also not have a free-for-all, let a thousand flowers bloom and see what the experiments produce.
THe word "eugenics" has worked, in part, because it is not properly defined.
It is not clear where good selection ends and bad selection begins.
In some way, we have been lying.
There is no way of drawing such a line.
In much the same way as with the abortion debate where neither the pro-choice not the pro-life camps make sense, the pro-hacking and anti-hacking positions make no sense.
We are just left with a permanent struggle between spectra of choices.

If we say that we cannot do this then that is the wrong position.
Who wants to have a kid who will die of some terrible genetic disease when we have the technology to save that kid?
Who wants to see their parents suffer from dementia if we can remove that condition as a possibility?
It would be insane for us to say that we have these powerful tools that will let us do unimaginable good and we're just not going to use them because these tools also have dangerous use-cases.
If that had been the case, we would not be using cars, we would not be using plows, or any other technology.
This is the position of the Amish that it's a slippery slope.
Some slippery slopes are great.
We can solve one disease and learn from that how to solve another disease.
Dinner and a movie is a slippery slope to love and marriage.

We need to find a good place in the middle.
On the one hand He Jiankui is a villain and we have seen the danger of Nazi Germany.
On the other hand we are excited about the idea of freeing people from the risk of breast cancer and perhaps even enhancing cognitive ability.
But is such sobriety even possible?
These technologies are getting cheaper and more powerful.
This usually means that the technology is moving into someone's garage.
There is already a DIY-bio movement and bio-hacker groups.
There was recently a man who created a functional nuclear reactor from the radioactive elements in hundreds of discarded smoke detectors.
This cannot be stopped by simply criminalizing such ventures and having panels on ethics.
The cost of genetic modification, our lack of power and knowledge, and our clumsiness has so far allowed us to hide from this most dangerous question.
With these factors going away, we will soon have to confront ourselves.

The word eugenics is used as a cudgel.
When someone starts talking of eugenics, the response is "Oh I'm against eugenics."
This is, in many ways, appropriate because so many terrible things have been done in the name of eugenics.
The word eugenics is forever tarred.
Perhaps we need a new word.
Something like "selection".
Yet when we talk of selection, we are immediately in Mengele territory, selecting who gets to live and who gets to die.
But we are talking about situations in which you have some embryos in a dish and you have to pick one.
What are the criteria by which you make your choice of which embryo you want implanted?
If you say that you want a child who is not going to die of some terrible genetic disease then that too is selection.
It is a normative choice set not in some abstract, objective world but in the context of our current reality.
This is one small step away from the data on abortions of down-syndrome babies.
This is **not** a normative statement saying to parents that their down-syndrome children have less of a right to exist.
We already know, from the abortion data, that if people have the choice then in most cases they will not choose to implant the embryo with down syndrome.

In '53 when the double-helix structure was elucidated by Watson and Crick and then in '63 when the genetic code was figured out by Marshall and Nuremberg, that group of people was shocked that we only pretended to care out our identity in the from of these letters, this computer code if you will.
We never really accepted what they found.
Every time they started talking about identity and characteristics, they found that we were so attached to our pre-genetic understanding of ourselves that we would not give it up.
We will fight anyone tooth-and-nail that would try to tell us that our characteristics were really a consequence of information technology as developed by natural and sexual selection.
In many ways, we are stuck in a culture where we cannot update to assimilate the knowledge we gained 70 years ago.

Our new-found ability to look under the hood is challenging the many myths about ourselves that we have developed over thousands of years.
We love the idea that you can be anything you want.
"The world is your oyster."
"Just set your heart to it kid and you will go places."
This is just not true.
Take the narrow example of running.
Running is a standard human task that we have all evolved with.
We would run our prey to exhaustion in the hunter-gatherer era.
Yet there is nothing that most of us can do to be a champion marathon runner.
Between 1897, when we started keeping records of the Boston Marathon, and 1987 there were no winners of the Boston Marathon from either Kenya or Ethiopia.
Since 1987, while it has not exactly been total domination, a disproportionately large number of the champions are from a very small group of people from the same valley in Kenya and Ethiopia.
They are from one tribe, the Kelengin, in Kenya of 4 million people, and even then from one subtribe, the Nandi subtribe, of 1 million people.
This is genetics.
While we all have a genetic range of possibility and we should each aspire to be on the top end of that range, whatever that means in the context of our potential, but if I do not have the genetics to be the worlds faster marathoner, or swimmer, or abstract mathematician, I am simply not going to get there.

In the example of marathon runners we went from a situation of wide diversity, where victory really was up for grabs and it was mostly about athleticism, to a situation in which we have found the special people that are wildly well adapted to radiate heat, which is the limiting factor in marathon running.
The world was not connected enough to being in competitors from the Horn of Africa, and there was no prize or infrastructure around the marathons.
With these things in place that have brought us together, has this had a negative effect on the sport that we no longer even feel motivated to enter or watch?
In general, what happens when we have genetically optimized people in sports?
Will we even care?
But this has already been happening, and we just did not know.
For example Michael Phelps, in addition to his extreme work ethic, training, and coaching, is genetically adapted to swimming.
His arms are a few standard-deviations too long for a man his build and this gives him greater ability to propel himself through water.

If we were to sequence out top performers, we would find that those people are genetically optimized for the tasks they perform.
We have, rightfully so, this fear of living in a Plato's Republic but we also do not want to live in a society where the mission-critical functions are not being performed by people that are most suited to those functions.
There is the old joke about the German chef and the Italian policeman.
Having the wrong person in the wrong job would hurt a society.

This clarity is hard to maintain when we go to the next example.
Let's look at the number of female chess players in the top 100 chess players in the world.
We find that at the top level of chess only one in a hundred is female and it is only a single protein, SRY, that determines weather a proto-human-being becomes male or female.
We are not comfortable accepting the same story of genetic optimization for chess that we have for marathon running.
It might be that a similar conclusion comes out of our understanding of genetics about the ability to play chess the way that the Boston Marathon understanding comes out of the genetics.
However, I do not know what kind of a society I would be living in if I were comfortable saying that there are such huge genetic disparities in cognitive ability.

Another dangerous example is that of Ashkenazi Jews, who represent one-quarter of one percent of the world's population, have won about 25 percent of the physics nobel prizes.
It is hard to think think of Judaism as also a breeding protocol of, over thousands of years, having the smartest people, the Rabbis, have as many children as possible, as opposed to the catholic priests who were supposed to be celibate.
It could also be that mathematical ability for lending money, which christians and muslims are not allowed allowed to do by religious doctrine, was selected for in jewish communities; and only very recently did this ability become extremely important in a world dominated by information technology and computer programming.
While I can accept that a small group of people from a narrow valley in Kenya and Ethiopia have a genetic advantage in marathon running, as soon as I kick it over into the realm of chess and physics, it does not feel good to even be thinking about these things.

These examples exist in the realm of our most taboo and difficult topics.
With the example of chess, it may be that the disparity is due to an obsessive trait rather than having anything to do with ability.
It could be that in order to be at the top of the chess pile you have to be completely obsessed with chess.
Several studies have shown that men rate more strongly on obsessive traits than do women, though other studies disagree.
It may also be that the rule-set of chess is such that men are more adapted to it.
We might easily see a game, say chess-prime, with a different rule set for which women are better adapted.
It would not at all be surprising to see the upper echelons of chess-prime be dominated by women.
But what if such a game does not helpfully materialize?
Do we even want such things to be investigated?
With our current knowledge of genetics, we cannot make the claim that certain men are genetically well adapted to chess.
There is a cautionary tale to be told here.
Harvard's math department was almost entirely male up to the late 1980s.
They had a desire to see women do well but there was to good track record so they would admit one every year.
One year the one female student decided to defer and the next year there were two female students in the department.
They formed a support group and both did extremely well at Harvard.
After this, there was a whole cohort that went through and have successful careers
It would have been easy for us tell a soft tale of "oh there are these genetic differences and we're looking at the tail ends ..."
While there is no way to hide from data, we cannot glibly assign an explanation while our understanding and knowledge of the real causes are lacking.

In the end, there are no dispassionate arbiters.
We often pretend that we are objective and that we can make these conclusions and yet relatively minor alterations to methodologies can yield wildly different results.
We need humility and modesty in our approach to what may seem at first blush to be extremely disturbing interpretations of the data.
We have to proceed in a scientific fashion and we cannot afford to always be thinking of the social consequences.
We also have to think of the social consequences and we cannot proceed blithely with the science.
This is where we are blocked in terms of the theme of this essay.
Can we use our new powers to find a graceful exit from this very powerful conundrum?
Perhaps conversation is the only such portal.

In the early 50s we unlocked two nuclei with fusion and the cell.
It is remarkable how little these discoveries have effected our lives.
We still resemble our ancestors from thousands of years ago.
We now stand on the verge of certain very dramatic changes.
Rather than going over the morality of it, here are some of the big changes we will see over the next two decades.

There will be a shift in healthcare from our current model of generalized healthcare to personalized precision healthcare.
Your doctor well need to know who you are.
This will require access to your health records, biometric information and most of all to your genetic information.
With the cost of genome sequencing trending towards zero, everyone is going to be sequenced as part of being in the healthcare system.
With this move towards precision medicine, there will be billions of people whose genetic and phenotypic information is going to be in massive big data pools.
We will use these datasets to increasingly demystify our biology and eventually move towards predictive medicine, healthcare, and life.
This will increasingly challenge our mythologies about ourselves.
Today we look at a baby and we say "the world is open to you."
But maybe only part of the world is open to you and rest is not because you are not genetically best-adapted for it.
In the movie Gattaca, Ethan Hawke is a man who was born in the old-fashioned way.
He wants to get into the space program, he pulls a lot of tricks and in the end he succeeds.
We watched this and said "isn't it so great that that guy was so determined?"
But should Ethan Hawke have been arrested for his own safety because do not want non-genetically enhanced people in the space program because they cannot survive the radiation of space?
The stories that we tell ourselves are going to have to change.
The idea that we will have predictive life is going fundamentally change things.
We might find some person in a refugee camp who has the potential to be the next Mozart and we would want to ensure that we get resources to that person.

We will see the genetic revolution move out of the realm of healthcare.
We will change how we reproduce.
There will be and increasing shift towards IVF.
The number of babies born in the US is 2%, Japan is 5%, Norway and Denmark are 10%.
These numbers are going to continue to rise.
Once we take conception outside of the human body then we will be able to apply in many incredible ways but also in ways that will scare a lot of people.

One fear is that we will make decisions about the future of our species based on what feel like eternal truths but are in fact transient fashions.
If we asked people today, they would say that they want a kid with good health, who would live a long life, be intelligent, and maybe tall.
These are traits that are fine to have and people who have them are thriving in our current environment.
But our genetic diversity is not just some nice-to-have thing.
It is the sole survival mechanism of any species.
This diversity that we have inherited over four billion years, we will have to choose it.
We will have to identify what we mean by diversity and celebrate it.
There are existential level risks from making our species less diverse.

Not only that but now individual actors now have the power to wreak havoc on a scale previously only possible for nations.
We are in the age of DIY bio-hacking.
Technologies like CRISPR-CAS9 are going to be cheap enough to edit genomes in a highschool biology project.
In late 2017/early 2018 a group of Canadian researchers used the tools of synthetic biology to create an active version of horsepox. as relative of smallpox.
That was from a grant of 100,000 dollars.
Today we could do it for 50,000 dollars and in five years, 5,000 dollars.
With these bio-lego-bricks we will have the tools to remake life.
Just as we have these tools to do good, we will have the potential to do great evil.

National cultures around these technologies also differ.
We need to worry about some of the national cultures that are the most gung-ho about exploiting these technologies.
We need to worry about geo-political tensions with biology being the next battlefield where we will not even know if war has been declared.
China is the major concern.
Let's first consider the positive story from China.
China is collecting massive datasets by collecting information about its people.
While these datasets can and are being used to oppress people, they can also be used to a lot of things that we consider good.
These datasets will enable their analysts to develop actionable insights about how cancers form, about predisposition to certain diseases, and responses to certain treatments.
This is going to be of immense help to Chinese healthcare and could also help us.
China has many things.
They have a lot of money, incredibly talented people, a nearly unrestrained scientific culture, and very few limits on what the government is prepared to do.
These are translating into very aggressive applications of revolutionary science and genetics is at the forefront.

In the United States we have many self-imposed, and in many cases rational, restrictions on which boundaries we are willing to push.
But is it prudent to hold back in this way if China is not going to be restrained?
In other words, does it become ethical to compete because lack of competition means ceding the game to an actor we think is less ethical?
We could have the same conversation about lethal autonomous weapons.
By developing autonomous weapons we lay the foundation for humans being wiped out, but not developing them we empower the other country that is developing them.
While we need to be competitive on these technologies, we cannot lose our humanity in their pursuit.
This is a societal race and it is not that the country with the first genetically enhanced human wins the race.
The country that is first to figure out how to use the resources of its society as a whole to realize its objectives, whatever those may be, is the country that wins the race.

There is often no good place to stand on with these issues and we struggle to communicate these to the world.
We now have so much information about ourselves and we have so many social needs that our technological needs and our social needs are at risk of clashing in a profoundly destructive manner before we can figure this out.

We each can move the dial a little in the direction of utopian or a little in the direction of dystopian.
We need to infuse the conversations about values and norms into the development of these powerful technologies.
We have examples of this from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and international treaties around biological weapons.
This story is going to play out in utopian ways and in dystopian ways side-by-side.
We are on a J-curve and our technology is going to become ever more powerful.
The sophistication of our tools is growing.

We can moralize all we want but this going to play out, ironically, according to a system of selective pressures.
Selection is not really only about biology.
Anything that has the three properties of variability, heritability, and differential success is going to behave in a darwinian fashion.
The social interpretation of this is that variability constitutes the human value of diversity, heritability has to do with what we call privilege and differential success has to do with inequality.
The maddening thing about biology is that we take this cherished value of diversity, we subject it to privilege, it produces an inequality, and we take that inequality as the feedback into the system.
With bio-hacking we are going to move from obligate-heritability to facultative-heritability.
In effect we will give some one who is not blessed with the genetics that they may want with genetics that is borrowed from some where else.
We will become the designer in our design.
In this way we will break evolution and biology at a fundamental level.
We will see a cambrian explosion of successors to homo-sapien.
After 3.8 billion years of evolution by random mutation and natural selection, we are turning a corner.
We cannot accurately image where this will go over hundreds or thousands of years.
What we can say is that we have, over many thousands of years, developed ethical codes that help us live better lives.
At the very least, we need to be fighting to make sure that our best individual and collective values are integrated into the decision-making process.

"We are gods but for the wisdom."
