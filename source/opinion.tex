Opinion here.

We expect our new phones to be better, faster and different from our old phones.
But we imagine biology as fixed.
This will change over the 21st century.

The scary side of this is that we will make choices about our children based on factors beyond simple health.
We will know the probabilities of personality traits, intelligence, height etc. and will choose according to the cultural and economic norms of the day.
Take Sickle cell anemia as an example.
If you carry two alleles of the trait, you will likely die.
However, if you are a recessive carrier then you have much higher resistance against malaria at some cost to you hemoglobin's ability to carry oxygen.
This trait emerged as a desperate adaptation to the deadly threat of malaria.
However, malaria is nonexistent in the United States and sickle cell anemia is seen as a disease.
Through embryo selection, we can select out the gene for sickle cell anemia, leaving us vulnerable to a reemergence of malaria.
We have no idea what recessive traits we may be carrying that could help our species survive some threat that we have not faced in recorded history.
