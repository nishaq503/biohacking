\begin{abstract}
    The Biotech and Genetic revolutions are advvancing at a feverish pace.
    Where once we played dice with the selective breeding of plants and animals, we are now capable of nucleotide-level precision in the changes we can make to the source code of life.
    Just as the 20$^{th}$ century was the century of physics, the 21$^{st}$ century will be the century of biology.
    With tools like CRISPR, we will become the designer of our own design.
    As we advance and change the very meaning of life, we must also advance our ethical norms.
    As the scientists spearheading these revolutions, the future of our society and our species is in our hands.
